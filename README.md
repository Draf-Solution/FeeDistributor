# FundsDistributor

Currently Opensea only supports royalty fees to be sent to only one address. In order to utilize Opensea's framework but have the royalty fees to be distributed in a ratio predefined, this smartcontract is created to store the funds from the royalty fee and eventually be distributed to the respective EOAs addresses

Splits all the Native and ERC20 tokens to 3 EOA addresses after the withdraw function is pressed.

The 3 EOA addresses will receive the funds in the following ratios:-

1) 10%
2) 20%
3) 70%
